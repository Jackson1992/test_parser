.SH "NAME"
xs_socket \- create Crossroads socket
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBvoid *xs_socket (void \fR\fB\fI*context\fR\fR\fB, int \fR\fB\fItype\fR\fR\fB);\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fIxs_socket()\fR function shall create a Crossroads socket within the specified \fIcontext\fR and return an opaque handle to the newly created socket\&. The \fItype\fR argument specifies the socket type, which determines the semantics of communication over the socket\&.
.sp
The newly created socket is initially unbound, and not associated with any endpoints\&. In order to establish a message flow a socket must first be connected to at least one endpoint with \fBxs_connect\fR(3), or at least one endpoint must be created for accepting incoming connections with \fBxs_bind\fR(3)\&.
.PP
\fBKey differences to conventional sockets\fR. Generally speaking, conventional sockets present a
\fIsynchronous\fR
interface to either connection\-oriented reliable byte streams (SOCK_STREAM), or connection\-less unreliable datagrams (SOCK_DGRAM)\&. In comparison, Crossroads sockets present an abstraction of an asynchronous
\fImessage queue\fR, with the exact queueing semantics depending on the socket type in use\&. Where conventional sockets transfer streams of bytes or discrete datagrams, Crossroads sockets transfer discrete
\fImessages\fR\&.
.sp
Crossroads sockets being \fIasynchronous\fR means that the timings of the physical connection setup and tear down, reconnect and effective delivery are transparent to the user and organized by Crossroads library itself\&. Further, messages may be \fIqueued\fR in the event that a peer is unavailable to receive them\&.
.sp
Conventional sockets allow only strict one\-to\-one (two peers), many\-to\-one (many clients, one server), or in some cases one\-to\-many (multicast) relationships\&. With the exception of \fIXS_PAIR\fR, Crossroads sockets may be connected \fBto multiple endpoints\fR using \fIxs_connect()\fR, while simultaneously accepting incoming connections \fBfrom multiple endpoints\fR bound to the socket using \fIxs_bind()\fR, thus allowing many\-to\-many relationships\&.
.PP
\fBThread safety\fR. Crossroads
\fIsockets\fR
are
\fInot\fR
thread safe\&. Applications MUST NOT use a socket from multiple threads except after migrating a socket from one thread to another with a "full fence" memory barrier\&.
.PP
\fBSocket types\fR. Crossroads defines several messaging patterns which encapsulate exact semantics of a particular topology\&. For example, publish\-subscribe pattern defines data distribution trees while request\-reply defines networks of shared stateless services\&. Each pattern defines several socket types (roles in the pattern)\&.
.sp
The following sections present the socket types defined by Crossroads library:
.SS "Request\-reply pattern"
.sp
The request\-reply pattern is used for sending requests from a \fIclient\fR to one or more instances of a stateless \fIservice\fR, and receiving subsequent replies to each request sent\&.
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
\fBXS_REQ\fR
.RS 4
.sp
A socket of type \fIXS_REQ\fR is used by a \fIclient\fR to send requests to and receive replies from a \fIservice\fR\&. This socket type allows only an alternating sequence of \fIxs_send(request)\fR and subsequent \fIxs_recv(reply)\fR calls\&. Each request sent is load\-balanced among all \fIservices\fR, and each reply received is matched with the last issued request\&.
.sp
When a \fIXS_REQ\fR socket enters an exceptional state due to having reached the high water mark for all \fIservices\fR, or if there are no \fIservices\fR at all, then any \fBxs_send\fR(3) operations on the socket shall block until the exceptional state ends or at least one \fIservice\fR becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded\&.

\fBXS_REP\fR
.RS 4
.sp
A socket of type \fIXS_REP\fR is used by a \fIservice\fR to receive requests from and send replies to a \fIclient\fR\&. This socket type allows only an alternating sequence of \fIxs_recv(request)\fR and subsequent \fIxs_send(reply)\fR calls\&. Each request received is fair\-queued from among all \fIclients\fR, and each reply sent is routed to the \fIclient\fR that issued the last request\&. If the original requester doesn\(cqt exist any more the reply is silently discarded\&.
.sp
When a \fIXS_REP\fR socket enters an exceptional state due to having reached the high water mark for a \fIclient\fR, then any replies sent to the \fIclient\fR in question shall be dropped until the exceptional state ends\&.

A socket of type \fIXS_PAIR\fR can only be connected to a single peer at any one time\&. No message routing or filtering is performed on messages sent over a \fIXS_PAIR\fR socket\&.
.sp
When a \fIXS_PAIR\fR socket enters an exceptional state due to having reached the high water mark for the connected peer, or if no peer is connected, then any \fBxs_send\fR(3) operations on the socket shall block until the peer becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded\&.

\fIXS_PAIR\fR sockets are experimental, and are currently missing several features such as auto\-reconnection\&.
